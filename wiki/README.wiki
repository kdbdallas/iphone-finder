----------

This is the start of a finder utility for the iPhone.

For the Windows fanboys Finder == Windows Explorer.

This is still in a VERY VERY early state, and doesn't really do much yet.

It is based off of the iPhoneNES ROM viewer.

If you are interested in helping out, please let me know as I am a newbie to Objective-C.
