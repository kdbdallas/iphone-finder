# UPDATE #
iPhone-Finder has merged with [MobileFinder](http://code.google.com/p/mobilefinder/) and become a part of the new [MobileStudio](http://code.google.com/p/mobilestudio/)!

## MobileStudio ##
_A Studio of Applications for the iPhone_

MobileStudio is a collection of file manipulation programs for the iPhone. The collection will eventually include all of the programs needed to make the iPhone a usable computing platform on it's own.

This is the start of a finder utility for the iPhone.

For the Windows fanboys Finder == Windows Explorer.

This is still in an early state.

It is based off of the [iPhoneNES](http://code.google.com/p/iphonenes/) ROM viewer.

If you are interested in helping out, please let me know as I am a newbie to Objective-C.


**UPDATE:** Version 0.0.3 launches executables (programs)
